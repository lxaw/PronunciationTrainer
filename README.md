# Pronunciation Trainer

## Using waveforms to help learn pronunciations.

## :grey_question: What is it?
* Many people try "shadowing" when learning languages. See more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_shadowing
* I thought that I would make a program that would help with that. 
* Basically, the program displays a word (in target language) along with its audio wave form. You can then record your pronunciation and compare the waveforms.

###### :seedling: Ideas for Improvement:
* Check out audio spectrogramming: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram
## :zap: Features:
* Creates waveform images of audio!
* Records and plays audio!
* Allows for comparison of waveforms!
* Animations and such.

###### :hammer: To do:
* Clean it up a bit. Likely need fewer packages, but I am unfamiliar with much of them.
